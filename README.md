# JS-stroll

This repo is comprised of tiny JavaScript and SVG excercises for generative effects. Rewriting code from 'The Nature of Code', originally written in Processing, in JavaScript to solidify the unerlying concepts. Also rewriting Rachel Smith's Hack Physics with JavaScript posts in SVG and vanilla JS (originals are in Canvas). Commented at the top of the main.js file of every directory is the url to the original code as well as a codepen demo of the output.
